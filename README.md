Numerical Methods coursework for ITBA

## Dependencies
- numpy
- PIL

or just run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

`python main.py some_image.png`


### Note

This code is just a benchmark of the compression ratio but could be adapted for use by adding some kind of serialization for the resulting transformed images/matrices.
